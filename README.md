Games are a powerful way to learn new material, programming a card game has always been a secret interest of mine. This particular version offers several features that most standard, already-deployed blackjack games include.

The key features of this game include entering in a betting amount, pressing buttons to indicate a betting amount as well as all the action-based buttons. Hitting and staying during the hand are among the most basic features of the blackjack game. In addition this game includes a double down features which gives you one card only, then doubles your bet. Programming a game like blackjack requires loads of patience.

This blackjack game will keep visitors engaged as they attempt to reach the 2017 point goal.
